# ISKRA-reader

This is an attempt to create a program which periodicly reads the P0 utility meter according to IEC 62056-21:2002(E) 6.3.1
Program is designed to run on Raspbian installed on a Raspberry Pi with a USB IR serial reader, 
but I see no reason why it shouldn't run on other Linux systems.

It isn't a clean set of code, but I'm not a real programmer. So please forgive my programming.

It will not run on a windows system without modifications.
